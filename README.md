# about-me
answer-one
I grew up in a small town near the Minnesota/ North Dakota border. I lived there for most of my life. I moved to Nebraska and lived there for a year and then moved to Massachusetts. I have a Bachlors degree in Microbiology. 

In my very little free time I like to read fantasy novels, crochet, and I love to bake. I also enjoy being outdoors but have not had much of a chance to explore any trails.
